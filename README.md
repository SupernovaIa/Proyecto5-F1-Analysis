# 🏎️ F1 2023 Season Analysis

![F1 2023 Season](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cd75147-6bb1-4d65-85ad-0e0324fb30f1)

## 📜 Project Overview

This project leverages data obtained from APIs, complemented by web scraping, to gather detailed information on the 2023 F1 season. The primary data sources are the Ergast API and the FastF1 library, with additional data enrichment from Wikipedia for circuit details and the official F1 website for "Driver of the Day" results.

The Ergast API offers a comprehensive archive of historical data across all F1 seasons, covering drivers, constructors, lap times, and full race results.

The FastF1 library provides both real-time and historical data through its backend or the F1Timing APIs. It also supports access to Ergast for historical data prior to 2018, making it especially valuable for creating visualizations and offering data frame manipulation methods tailored for Formula 1 analytics.

**Important note**: Sprint races have not been included in this version of the project.

### Specific Objectives
- **Data Extraction**: Extract information using the mentioned API and websites.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean and structure the data appropriately.
- **Database Storage**: Create an SQL database to store the collected data in a structured format.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct various analyses using Python, Pandas, and data visualization:
  - **Championship Results**: Analyze the drivers' and constructors' championship results.
  - **Wins and Podium Distribution**: Study which drivers secured the most podiums and victories.
  - **Positions Gained/Lost**: Identify which drivers gained or lost the most positions during races compared to their starting positions.
  - **Driver of the Day**: Study which drivers were most often awarded by the fans.
  - **Analysis of Specific Driver Results**: Examine the temporal performance evolution of specific drivers like Fernando Alonso throughout the season.

## 📊 Results and Conclusions

The analysis of the 2023 F1 season led to the following insights:

- **`Max Verstappen`'s dominance**: `Max Verstappen`, along with `Red Bull`, dominated the 2023 season impressively, with the Dutch driver winning 19 out of 22 races.

- **`Aston Martin`'s decline**: The team from Silverstone started the season very strong but soon struggled, resulting in more inconsistent performances.

- **`McLaren`'s rise**: In contrast to `Aston Martin`, `McLaren` showed the most significant improvement over the season. Starting from round 9 and particularly after round 14, they managed to climb up to fourth place in the constructors' standings, setting a solid foundation for the next season.

- **Driver of the Day**: `Lando Norris` was the most frequently awarded Driver of the Day, receiving this recognition five times. His popularity, combined with his standout performances and `McLaren`'s resurgence, placed him at the top of this category.

## 🔄 Next Steps

- **Adding Sprint Races**: The next key step is to include sprint races in the analysis, as they contribute points that can affect overall results.
- **Expanding the analysis to specific drivers and races**: Conduct analyses for more specific drivers and races to cover the entire grid and calendar.
- **Analyzing more seasons**: Extend the analysis to include more historical or future seasons.
